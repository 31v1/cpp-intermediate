🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Inventory Control Protocol
--

Every component in the facility has an ID and a name. Ursov must maintain a registry to keep track of all parts and ensure they are sorted for quick retrieval.

🎯 Objective
--
Store components in a struct and sort them by ID.

🧩 Requirements
--

* Define a struct with fields for component ID and name.

* Store multiple components in an array of structs.

* Implement a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble or selection) to order by ID.

* Display the sorted list.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced
--

* Structs

* Arrays of structs

* Sorting algorithms

* Output formatting
