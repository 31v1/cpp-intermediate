🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Central Integration Protocol
--

After months of training and countless smaller assignments, Belyy Ursov has earned the responsibility of overseeing the facility’s central monitoring system. This is no longer a single task: it is the integration of everything she has learned. Arrays, structs, validation, multi‑step processing, and interactive menus must now work together in one cohesive program.

The Polar Aerospace Operations Base depends on Ursov’s ability to unify these systems. Fuel consumption, sensor readings, operator records, and mission checklists all converge here. The Arctic does not forgive mistakes — and Ursov knows that professionalism, discipline, and a touch of dry humor are the only way to survive long nights surrounded by machinery that was never designed for paws.

🎯 Objective  
--
Build a mini‑project that integrates all previous concepts into a single monitoring system.

🧩 Requirements
--

Implement a menu console that allows operators to navigate different subsystems.

Include modules for:

* Sensor statistics (average, max, sanitization)

* Component registry (add, list, search, sort)

* Access code validation

* Mission checklist verification

* Fuel and conveyor analysis

Ensure multi‑step processing: data must be validated, processed, and summarized before being displayed.

Present results in a clear, dashboard‑style format.

* Structs

* Functions (with and without return values)

* Input validation

* Switch statements
