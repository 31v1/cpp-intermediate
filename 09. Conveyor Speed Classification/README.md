🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Conveyor Monitoring Protocol
--

The conveyor belts move supplies across the facility, from fuel canisters to frozen rations. Their speeds must be carefully monitored: too slow and cargo risks freezing solid mid‑transport, too fast and cargo risks being launched into the snow.
Belyy Ursov is tasked with classifying each speed reading to ensure safe and efficient operations.

🎯 Objective  
--
Classify conveyor speed readings into operational ranges.

🧩 Requirements
--

*    Read multiple speed values into an array.

*    Use conditional logic to classify each reading as Low, Normal, or High.

*    Print the classification for each speed (e.g., Speed 45 → Normal).
