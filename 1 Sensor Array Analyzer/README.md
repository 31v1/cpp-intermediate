## Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Systems Routine 12‑A
This exercise introduces the use of arrays to process multiple sensor readings — a fundamental skill for handling structured data inside the Polar Aerospace Operations Base.
During this routine, Belyy Ursov reviews a batch of thermal sensor values and classifies each reading according to operational thresholds.

As part of her intermediate training, Belyy Ursov performs a routine analysis of thermal sensor data collected from the northern corridor of the base.
Although the task is straightforward, maintaining accurate classifications is essential for monitoring structural stability in extreme Arctic conditions.
Her steady, methodical approach ensures that no anomaly goes unnoticed.

🧊 Objective
--
Create a program that:

Asks the user how many readings will be entered (maximum 50).

Stores the readings in an integer array.

Processes each reading and prints a classification:

"Stable reading" for values between 0 and 50

"Warning: elevated reading" for values between 51 and 100

"Critical: out-of-range reading" for values above 100

"Invalid reading" for negative values

Produces a final summary showing how many readings fell into each category.
