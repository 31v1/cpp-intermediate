## Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Systems Routine 12‑A
During this routine, Belyy Ursov performs a routine analysis of thermal sensor data collected from the northern corridor of the base.

Belyy needs to enter a set of thermal sensor readings for analysis.
Each reading must be classified according to operational thresholds:

If the value is between 0 and 50, report: Stable reading

If the value is between 51 and 100, report: Warning: elevated reading

If the value is above 100, report: Critical: out-of-range reading

If the value is negative, report: Invalid reading

After processing all readings, the program must display a summary counting how many values fell into each category.
