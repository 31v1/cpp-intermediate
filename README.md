# cpp-intermediate

A collection of intermediate‑level C++ exercises covering topics such as functions, arrays, basic data structures, modular program design, and multi‑step data processing.

These exercises are licensed under **CC BY‑NC‑SA 4.0**.  
You may consult and modify the code for learning purposes, but copying it verbatim for academic submission is not allowed.

Do not be misled by the playful tone: the exercises are as challenging as any textbook example. The story exists only to make the process less monotonous — not easier.

## 🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Technical Training Module II

After completing the foundational training in **cppbasic**, the polar bear cosmonauts assigned to the Polar Aerospace Operations Base advance to a new stage of technical preparation.  
This module focuses on developing stronger programming skills required for **mid‑level operational tasks** inside the facility.

The tone remains the same: serious industrial work performed by highly trained polar operators, with just enough dry humor to acknowledge the unusual nature of the workforce.

This stage of training follows the ongoing story of **Belyy Ursov**, the polar bear cosmonaut introduced in *cppbasic*. Now stationed at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, she handles increasingly complex tasks — always with professionalism, always in the cold, and always surrounded by machinery that somehow tolerates paws.

This module introduces:

- Structured data handling  
- Multi‑step processing  
- More organized program design  
- Practical logic used in the base’s internal systems  

All essential for maintaining operations under extreme Arctic conditions.
