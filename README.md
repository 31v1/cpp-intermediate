## Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Technical Training Module II
After completing the foundational training in cppbasic, the polar bear cosmonauts assigned to the Polar Aerospace Operations Base advance to a new stage of technical preparation.
This module focuses on developing stronger programming skills required for mid‑level operational tasks inside the facility.

The tone remains the same:
serious industrial work performed by highly trained polar operators,
with just enough dry humor to acknowledge the unusual nature of the workforce.

This module introduces structured data handling, multi‑step processing, and more organized program design — all essential for maintaining the base’s systems under extreme Arctic conditions.

🧊🐻 Objectives of the Module
By the end of cpp‑intermediate, the trainee (bear or human) will be able to:

Process and analyze collections of data

Use functions to structure programs

Implement menus and modular logic

Work with arrays and simple data structures

Validate and transform input in more complex ways

Generate summaries and reports

Simulate small operational subsystems of the base

All exercises remain fully aligned with the logic used in real technical interviews — the lore is just a thematic wrapper.

🧊🐻 Exercises Overview
1. Sensor Array Analyzer
The cosmonaut processes a list of sensor readings using arrays, identifying anomalies and stable values.

2. Temperature Log Summary
Given a set of Arctic temperature logs, compute minimum, maximum, and average values.

3. Shift Report Formatter
Break the program into multiple functions to collect data, process it, and output a formatted report.

4. Equipment Diagnostics Menu
Implement a simple text‑based menu using switch to run different diagnostic routines.

5. Fuel Cell Stability Check
Use functions that return values to evaluate the stability of fuel cell readings.

6. Arctic Inventory Tracker
Represent equipment items using structs and process a small inventory list.

7. Communication Packet Validator
Analyze simple strings to validate transmission codes used in the base’s communication system.

8. Multi‑Day Weather Recorder
Use 2D arrays to store temperature readings across multiple days and shifts.

9. Maintenance Task Scheduler
Simulate a basic scheduling system using arrays, loops, and functions.

10. Mission Summary Generator
Integrate everything: arrays, functions, validation, and structures to produce a final operational summary for the base.

🧊🐻 Concepts Practiced
Arrays (1D and 2D)

Functions (with and without return values)

Switch statements

Structs

Basic string handling

Modular program design

Data summarization

Input validation

Multi‑step processing

🧊🐻 Narrative Continuity
This module continues the story of the polar bear cosmonaut introduced in cppbasic.
Now stationed at the Polar Aerospace Operations Base, the operator handles increasingly complex tasks — still with professionalism, still in the cold, still surrounded by machinery that somehow tolerates paws.
