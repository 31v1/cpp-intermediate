# 01 — Sensor Average Calculator

🧊 **Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Sensor Calibration Task**

As part of Belyy Ursov’s intermediate‑level training, she must verify the accuracy of the hangar’s thermal sensors.  
This routine calibration ensures that temperature readings remain reliable under extreme Arctic conditions.

## 🎯 Objective
Read **10 temperature values** from the operator and compute the **average temperature** using a helper function.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Store the 10 readings in an array.
- Implement a function that receives the array and returns the computed average.
- Display the final result with clear formatting.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Arrays  
- Functions with return values  
- Basic data processing
