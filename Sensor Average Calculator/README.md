# 01 — Sensor Average Calculator

🧊 **Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Sensor Calibration Task**

The hangar’s thermal monitoring system requires periodic verification to ensure that temperature sensors remain accurate under extreme Arctic conditions.  
As part of Belyy Ursov’s intermediate‑level training, she must process a batch of raw sensor readings and compute their average.

## 🎯 Objective
Read **10 temperature values** from the operator and compute the **average temperature** using a helper function.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Store the 10 readings in an array.
- Implement a function that receives the array and returns the computed average.
- Display the final result with clear formatting.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Arrays  
- Functions with return values  
- Basic data processing  

## 🐻 Narrative Context
This task simulates a routine calibration procedure performed inside the Polar Aerospace Operations Base.  
Even though the sensors are designed to withstand sub‑zero environments, the operators (including those with paws) must verify their accuracy regularly.
