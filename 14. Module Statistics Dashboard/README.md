🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Systems Overview Protocol
--

Each module in the facility reports performance metrics. Belyy Ursov must compute global statistics and present a dashboard summary, because operators prefer numbers neatly arranged instead of scattered across frozen printouts.

🎯 Objective  
--
Process module data and generate a statistical summary.

🧩 Requirements
--

*    Store metrics for multiple modules in an array of structs.

*    Compute totals, averages, and identify extremes.

*    Display results in a clear dashboard format.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced
--

*    Arrays of structs

*    Statistics (sum, average, min, max)

*    Modular program design

*    Output formatting
