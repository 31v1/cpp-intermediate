# Polar Access Code Validator

🧊 **Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Secure Entry Protocol**

Before accessing restricted areas of the facility, Belyy Ursov must validate incoming access codes.  
These codes follow strict formatting rules to prevent unauthorized entry — even if most intruders would freeze long before reaching the door.

## 🎯 Objective
Validate a **5‑character access code** that must begin with `"BX-"`.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Continuously request input until a valid code is entered.
- The code must:
  - be exactly 5 characters long  
  - start with `"BX-"`  
- Display a confirmation message once the code is accepted.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- String handling  
- Input validation  
- Conditional logic
