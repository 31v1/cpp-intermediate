🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Operator Management Protocol
--

Managing operator records in the facility requires precision and structure. Belyy Ursov must implement a console menu system that allows polar operators to add, list, and delete records. Even in the Arctic, bureaucracy marches on — and Ursov ensures it runs smoothly, paws and all.

🎯 Objective
--
Create an interactive menu system using switch and functions.

🧩 Requirements
--

*    Display a menu with options: Add, List, Delete, Exit.

*    Use switch to handle user choices.

*    Store operator records in an array of structs.

 *   Implement functions for each menu action to keep the program modular.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced
--

*    Switch statements

 *   Functions

 *   Arrays of structs

 *   Modular program design
