🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Rapid Retrieval Protocol

Operators often need to locate a specific component by its ID in the registry. Belyy Ursov must ensure that the search system can quickly identify items, even when the inventory is long and the paws are clumsy.

🎯 Objective  
Search for a component by ID in an array of structs.

🧩 Requirements

*    Use the component registry created earlier.

*    Prompt the user for a component ID.

*   Perform a linear search through the array.

*    Display the component’s details if found, or a clear error message if not.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced

*    Arrays of structs

*    Linear search

*    Conditional logic

*    Input/output handling
