# Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Systems Routine 7‑C
During this routine, Belyy Ursov reviews a set of temperature logs collected from various monitoring points inside the facility.

Belyy needs to enter several temperature readings. The program must analyze the data and produce a summary with the following information:

Minimum temperature recorded

Maximum temperature recorded

Average temperature across all readings

The number of readings is provided by Belyy at the start of the program.
