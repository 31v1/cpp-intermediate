🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Sensor Integrity Protocol
--

The facility’s sensors occasionally produce invalid readings: negative values, impossible spikes, or numbers that suggest the Arctic suddenly turned tropical.
Belyy Ursov must sanitize the dataset before analysis, ensuring that only valid information is used to keep the systems running safely.

🎯 Objective  
--
Filter invalid readings and compute an adjusted average.

🧩 Requirements
--

*    Read multiple sensor values into an array.

*    Identify and discard invalid values (e.g., negatives or unrealistic spikes).

*    Compute the average of the remaining valid readings.

*    Display both the cleaned dataset and the adjusted average.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced
--
*   Arrays

*   Data validation

*    Multi‑step processing

*    Basic statistics
