# 02 — Maximum Pressure Detector

🧊 **Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Pressure Integrity Check**

During routine maintenance, Belyy Ursov must verify that the pressure sensors inside the compression chamber are functioning correctly.  
To do this, she analyzes a batch of recorded pressure values and identifies the highest reading.

## 🎯 Objective
Determine the **maximum pressure value** in an array and report its **index**.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Read a set of pressure readings into an array.
- Implement a function that returns both the maximum value and its position.
- Display the result clearly to the operator.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced
- Arrays  
- Linear search  
- Functions returning computed results
