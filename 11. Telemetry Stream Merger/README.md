🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Data Integration Protocol
--

Two subsystems transmit telemetry in parallel: one for environmental readings, another for equipment status. Belyy Ursov must merge these streams into a single unified output, ensuring operators don’t have to juggle two consoles at once — paws are already busy enough.

🎯 Objective
--
Interleave two arrays into one combined telemetry stream.

🧩 Requirements
--

 *   Read two arrays of equal length.

*    Merge them by alternating elements from each array.

*    Display the resulting unified stream.

🛠️ Concepts Practiced
--

 *   Arrays

 *   Iteration

*    Data merging

 *   Output formatting
